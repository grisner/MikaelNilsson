        "description": `Neo4j’s query language Cypher supports loading data from CSV directly but not from JSON files or URLs.
            
        Almost every site offers some kind of API or endpoint that returns JSON and we can also query many NOSQL databases via HTTP and get JSON responses back.
        
        It’s quite useful to be able to ingest document structured information from all those different sources into a more usable graph model.
        
        I want to show here that retrieving that data and ingesting it into Neo4j using Cypher is really straightforward and takes only little effort.
        
        As Cypher is already pretty good at deconstructing nested documents, it’s actually not that hard to achieve it from a tiny program.
        
        I want to show you today how you can achieve this from Python, Javascript, Ruby, Java, and Bash.
        The Domain: StackOverflow
        
        Being a developer I love StackOverflow. Just crossed 20k reputation by only answering 1100 Neo4j related questions :). You can do that too. That’s why I want to use StackOverflow users with their question, answers and comments and tags as our domain today.

        Pulling StackOverflow information into a graph model allows me to find interesting insights, like:
        
            what are the people asking or answering about Neo4j also interested in,
        
            how is their activity distributed across tags and between questions, answers and comments
        
            which kinds of questions attract answers and which don’t
        
            looking at my own data, which answers to what kinds of questions got the highest approval rates
        
        We need some data and a model suited to answer those questions.
        StackOverflow API
        
        Stackoverflow offers an API to retrieve that information, it’s credential protected as usual, but there is the cool option to pre-generate an API-URL that encodes your secrets and allows you to retrieve data without sharing them. You can still control some parameters like tags, page size and page-number though.
        
        With this API-URL`,
